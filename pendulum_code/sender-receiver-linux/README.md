# Pendulum Sender and Receiver for Linux
This CMake project contains the code for following programs:
- Sender component for the sensor-side single-board computer
- Receiver component for the actuator-side single-board computer

All the code is written in C++. The following libraries are used:
- `sockpp` to open UDP sockets
- `CppLinuxSerial` to interact with the USB serial interface
- `nlohmann/json` to generate the JSON log files

`sockpp` and `CppLinuxSerial` are shared libraries: They must be installed on the system that is supposed to run the program. They are not included in the executable.
`nlohmann/json` is included in the source code of this project. Thus, the library is included in the executable.

## Preparation
### Installing CMake
Unfortunately, the APT repository only has an outdated version of CMake at the time of writing. Therefore, `sudo apt install cmake` doesn't work.

Instead, install executable from https://cmake.org/download/ .

To use CMake, you need to install `build-essential` too:
```
sudo apt install build-essential
```

### Installing `sockpp`
`sockpp` is a high-level socket library for C++.

```
git clone https://github.com/fpagliughi/sockpp.git
cd sockpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
sudo cmake --build . --target install
```

### Installing `CppLinuxSerial`
`CppLinuxSerial` is a library to access the serial ports in C++.

```
git clone https://github.com/gbmhunter/CppLinuxSerial.git
cd CppLinuxSerial
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

## Compiling the Source
```
mkdir cmake-build-debug
cd cmake-build-debug
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

To compile the different targets individually, you can also run instead of the last command:
```
cmake --build . --target pendulum_sender
cmake --build . --target pendulum_receiver
```

## Make Sure Dependencies are Found
You need to make sure that the shared libraries (`sockpp` and `CppLinuxSerial`) can be found. For this purpose, you need to add the path of the libraries (usually `/usr/local/lib`) to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable:
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

## Note About Connecting Teensy via USB
Sometimes, the serial socket doesn't work when the Teensy has been plugged in for a longer time.
In this case, there simply is no input from the serial interface, no errors.

To avoid this problem:
1. Unplug the Teensy
2. Plug in the Teensy
3. Launch the program on the single-board computer immediately (max 10 seconds after plugging in)


## Starting Configurations
The sender and receiver can be started with various parameter options:

### Starting the Sender
#### With single-run config file
````
./pendulum_sender f config_sender_single.json
````

#### With sequence config file
````
./pendulum_sender s config_sender_sequence.json
````

### Starting the Receiver
````
./pendulum_receiver config_receiver.json
````

}
```

with
- `b`: Bucket size of the token bucket
- `r`: Refill rate of the token bucket
- `numThresholds`: Number of thresholds given by the `thresholds` array.
- `thresholds`: Array of thresholds (floating point numbers) for the priority classes. The lowest threhold `- infinity` is ommited from the array.
- `prioMapping`: Array specifying the mapping from the thresholds to the priority classes (integers 0-7).
- `costs`: Array of costs associated with the priority classes. First element associated with best priority class.
- `bias` Bias as an integer value. Is *added* to the raw sensor value before sending it to the receiver. Default value: `0`
- `sendTriggeringApproach`: String. Determines the approach to trigger the sending of a new sensor value. Default: `slidingWindow`. Possible options:
    - `slidingWindow`: Uses a sliding window to determine the maximum absolute angle change. The sampling period is determined by the maximum absolute angle change.
      For this approach, the following parameters are required: `historySize`, `samplingPeriods`, `samplingPeriodSensitivityFactor`, `samplingPeriodSensitivityOffset`.
    - `simpleThreshold`: Uses a simple threshold. Whenever the absolute angle value exceeds the threshold, a new sensor value is sent.
        For this approach, the following parameter is required: `angleTransmissionThreshold`.
- `historySize`: Number of samples kept in the sensor history to determine the maximum absolute angle change.
- `samplingPeriods`: Array of 10 sampling periods in milliseconds, where the first element corresponds to the smallest change and the 10th element corresponds to the largest maximum absolute angle change.
- `initialPriorityClass`: Priority class used at start ()
- `samplingPeriodSensitivityFactor`: Factor by which the maximum absolute angle change is multiplied to determine sampling period. Default value: `1.0`
- `samplingPeriodSensitivityOffset`: Offset by which the maximum absolute angle change is shifted to determine sampling period. Default value: `0.0`
- `serialDeviceName`: Linux file which associated with the serial interface of the sender Teensy. If you set it to `auto`, the computer tries to recognize a Teensy device automatically. Default value: `auto`
- `receiverAddress`: IP address of the receiver PC
- `networkDelaysPerPrio`: Array of network delays in milliseconds (integers) for each priority class. Must have 8 elements. First element associated with the best priority class (0).
